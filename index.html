        The village of Clane, Co. Kildare is situated in the northern part of
        the county. Some thirty-four kilometers west of the capital city of Dublin,

        and thirteen kilometers
        from the university town of Maynooth. Clane is not as well known

        long and interesting part in the history of Ireland...
