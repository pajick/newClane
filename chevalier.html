                "The Chevalier" (Knight) Charles Wogan was born in Rathcoffey which
                is part of Clane parish.

                Is it possible that his heroic actions on the night of April 29th
                1719 have given rise to the romantic fairytale tradition that for
                every fair princess shut up in a castle tower there comes a knight
                in shining armour ready to set her free so that she can marry the
                handsome prince of her dreams?


                Wogan was a staunch supporter of the Royal Stuarts. He initiated
                the alliance which led to the marriage of James Edward Francis
                Stuart (the Old Pretender), son of Charles II, to Clementina
                Sobieski, daughter of John Sobieski, King of Poland. She was
                apprehended, however, on her way to marry the Prince in Bologna.
                She was held captive in Innsbruck in the Tyrol.


                Sir Charles arranged false passports with the Austrian Ambassador
                and along with a small group feigning to be a Count, Countess, the
                Countess’ brother (Wogan) and her maidservant, managed to gain
                access to the princess. Following a quick exchange of clothing
                between the princess and the maidservant, the party escaped in high
                winds and blinding snow through the Alpine passes into Italy.

                The marriage to James took place and from it Charles Edward (the
                Young Pretender) was born in Rome in 1720. Wogan’s reputation for
                daring and enterprise spread throughout all Europe.

                The Wogan-Browne family are regarded as the most historic family in
                the history of Clane. The earliest connection of the family to the
                area dates from 1317, when Sir John Wogan, Justiciar, who was ruling
                Ireland on behalf of the King, acquired the barony of Ikeaty and
                firmly established the family seat at Rathcoffey Castle.

            <div>This barony
                extended from the Rye Water at Kilcock to the Liffey at Richardstown.
                The connection ofthe Wogans and their successors the Wogan-Brownes to
                this area continued until the implementation of the Windham Land act
                of 1903 when the family sold the freehold rights of their remaining
                estates in the area. The family, however, continued to reside in Naas
                until the tragic death of Lt. John Wogan-Browne on 10 February 1922.

                <br />




                Lt Wogan-Browne who was an officer in the Royal Field Artillery in
                the army barracks in Kildare town was killed during an armed robbery
                of the regimental pay at hands of IRA members apparently acting
                without sanction. The tragic event took place in the transition
                period following independence when the British army were evacuating
                from the country.

                On the centenary of this event, Lt Wogan-Browne’s grand-nephew Charles
                Lillis and his wife Veronica visited John’s grave in St Corbans
                Cemetery, Naas. Three days later they visited the two family burial
                plots, the Old Abbey burial ground in Clane and the family mausoleum
                in Mainham Cemetery. Charles and Veronica viewing the Wogan and
                Wogan-Browne plaque on the wall of the Abbey Community Centre. <br />
                The legend on the plaque reads:
                <cite>
                    Wogan family. Anglo-Norman family owning lands here since the early
                    14th century, living in Rathcoffey Castle.</cite><br />
                They also visited the Wogan altar tomb, and the Wogan-Browne mausoleum
                in Mainham.
                <p>
                    Junior branches of the family emerged at Downings, Blackhall and
                    Richardstown. Rathcoffey Wogans inter-married with the Brownes of
                    Castlebrowne (Clongowes Wood), becoming 'Wogan-Browne'. Many are
                    famed internationally, and generations are buried here.
